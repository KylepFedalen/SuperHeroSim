# SuperHeroSim
A PyDev Game that I was working on throughout highschool

# below are some notes that I saved from when I was working on the project

Super hero management game
-----------------------------



Story
-------------
-you and your 3 friends from a comicbook club get superpowers and 
deside to form a superhero group.
-you have been given super inteligence so it is desided 
to have you moniter the police scaners and databaces.
-there is story in places whare it is shown that you slightly resent your frineds 
for getting "more usfull powers".
-gameplay continues untill the hidden psyc meter is maxed out on one of your friends 
and it causes them to kill some bank robbers while out on patrool


machanicas
-------------
-fame/infamay are a way of progressing as well as a way of rearching upgrades

-secret identiy meter is present for the player as well as every known super hero.
this deals with how close the goverment is to finding out who the corosponding hero is.
 a hero can choose to reviel there secret identity(ironman style)the player wont 
have controll over this most of the time(only if the heros "trust" in the player 
is high and they have been at HQ long. as well as a random chance)a diloulg box will pop up and the hero 
will ask the player if they think it would be better if they revield there secret identiy.

-psyc meter is a way to tell how a hero is doing psycologicly.it is draind by going on misions being on patroll and 
the secret identiy meter being below 25%. it is drained a signifagant amount when fighting a supervillin and even more when fighting a rouge hero. 
it affects how well a hero does on jobs and if low enough can end up getting people killed or result in the hero going rouge or becoming a super villin.

-scouting and recruiting heros

-prossing power introduced in the second stage it is a persentage bar that can be assigned scaning tasks that the player 
would have to manualy in the first stage.
it takes over the menial tasks of scaning police raidos and databaces and trashes the junk that the police can deal with that nobody will get hurt.
it can be used to scan for heros that are trying to stay unnoticed by looking for strange occurencinces that coinside with people being saved
 




porgresion
-------------
	reasearch is used not as choice but as pergresion to allow the player to feel in controll of not how they progress but when.also can be used as a
	way of makeing the player aware of critical michanics by making them click on them.
